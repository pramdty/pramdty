## About

I'm an undergraduate informatics student at Singaperbangsa University Karawang who's creative, adaptive, collaborative, and learning 
fast. Programming and creating web are some examples of my skills. I like to learn new things, as an example in the 5th semester I took 
an independent study about 3D Animation at Prima Academy. Working on many projects on campus, especially regarding data and web. 
I'm ready to succeed in any project because of my desire to make a significant contribution.
